      Sit down, this poem is long, but, hey...
      <br />
      You can’t go anywhere anyway….
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Class, you are unique in ITP history.
      <br />
      The reasons why are surely no mystery
      <br />
      Last at 721, First at 370 Jay..
      <br />
      And then (whomp!) the pandemic shut us down in a day.
      <br />
      What’s to say about this catastrophic year..
      <br />
      It’s 2020, I thought our vision would be clear.
      <br />
      Now life, globally, has changed in nearly every facet..
      <br />
      We’re worried about family, friends, the fate of our planet.
      <br />
      On one hand it’s ridiculous to write a jaunty rhyme
      <br />
      It feels awkward, blithe, out of step with the time.
      <br />
      On the other hand––whatever–– it’s all I can do…
      <br />
      So at risk of being the shmuck of all shmucks.
      <br />
      I’ll say, just to start, that this spring really sucks.
      <br />
      Hard not to feel you’ve been singularly robbed–
      <br />
      You have–
      <br />
      Most have cursed, overeaten and openly sobbed,
      <br />
      Gone stir-crazy, gone meta, zoomed-out & perplexed
      <br />
      Wondering when this will all be over and what will come next.
      <br />
      What I believe in my my gut and from the depth of my soul
      <br />
      Is our new ‘normal’ will demand a slew of new roles.
      <br />
      On this fragile earth––much pain, much loss, and so much to save.
      <br />
      What’s needed are minds–– creative, bold, clever and brave.
      <br />
      This class, all 106 of you, has the grit and persona
      <br />
      That will not be daunted or conquered by this nasty corona.
      <br />
      Aw, you’re just saying that (I heard you), but no, I’ve got proof.
      <br />
      370 Jay closed and you were confined apart under your roof,
      <br />
      Many of your thesis projects demanded a pivot:
      <br />
      A small sculpture–– now––that would have been an exhibit.
      <br />
      You prototyped in cardboard, and assumed all winter
      <br />
      You’d have access to the CNC, laser cutters and 3D printers.
      <br />
      It’s impossible, or nearly, to do good user testing
      <br />
      When everyone’s home––distracted,anxious, sequestering.
      <br />
      Some turned your bedrooms into makeshift labs.
      <br />
      Reconfigured kitchens and bathrooms into places to fab.
      <br />
      Some are home with parents...which has good and bad sides.
      <br />
      But you guys just dug in and took it all in your stride.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s taken a village to make this semester work.
      <br />
      The faculty, advisors, staff...and nary a jerk!
      <br />
      We’ve come through better than expected because of the care
      <br />
      of Dano--our big-hearted, hard-working, level-headed chair.
      <br />
      And George and Midori--they’re the top bananas
      <br />
      Thanks, Dante, Lenin, Marlon and Anna
      <br />
      To Paul for your emails, you write with such flair
      <br />
      To Rob, Yen and John, hurrah, and to newcomer Blair.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      You had to relearn how to learn, we had to rethink how to teach.
      <br />
      It had to happen so quickly...in less than a week!
      <br />
      So bravo to Allison, Tom, David, Ben Light
      <br />
      Luisa, Marianne, Gabe, Pedro and Katherine
      <br />
      (the end is in sight)

      <br />
      Now–– to the thesis advisors it’s time to move on.
      <br />
      Stefani, Zoe and Sarah--you’re troopers, you’re treasures.
      <br />
