This installation visualizes how data can shape a futuristic network of human society by physicalizing the relationship between each nation. ","abstract":"In the long history of human’s discovery of the world, there have been many different versions of geographic world maps. As the fast development of technologies, the world map is getting more and more “accurate”. However, the most common flat world map we see today is still full of distorted due to different projection methods. The United States is always in the center. Russia looks way bigger than it actually is. The current and historical maps were made with human’s vision towards the world at the time. Maps can be great tools for us to learn knowledge,  but it can also be misleading with the things it chose to show. <br><br>\r\nOver the last few years, the volume of data has exploded. There are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created each day at our current pace, but that pace is only accelerating. International Data Corporation predicts that the collective sum of the world’s data will grow from 33 zettabytes this year to 175 zettabytes by 2025. <br><br>\r\nIn the era of big data, is it possible to make a more “accurate” world map that minimizes the bias in showing information? Or due to unequal access to technology,  it is less possible. We cannot ignore the missing data, the vulnerable data, and data abuse. Therefore, for my thesis, I am investigating how data visualization can or cannot inform more “accurate” information.<br><br>\r\nThe world map tells us geographic information. If I feed this map some data, for example, the percentage of population using the internet from 1990 to 2017. It shows who contributes to the data explosion and how much. But besides staking color patches on top of our world, is there a better way we can show how data has impacted and distorted the world, beyond just showing number. \r\nWhat if, we look at our world only through data.  Will it be a Utopia or a Dystopia? Or in my case, a Forcetopia. ","context_research":"I.

Base on different datasets, it will show whether some countries are closely connected to or more isolated from each other. The physical installation is a modular kinetic sculpture controlled by real-time user interactions to the selected datasets. Each module is moved by 2 stepper motors and micro-controllers on both X and Y axis. The digital visualization is projection mapped to the physical installation to create animations and labels.
