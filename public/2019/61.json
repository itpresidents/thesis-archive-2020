What is the potential of emerging mediums to transform the way we experience and learn history? Stories Through Space is an exploration of Augmented Reality and Geolocation as a tool for interactive digital storytelling. \r\n","abstract":"Augmented Reality and Geolocation can be used as an engaging storytelling medium. With high­ speed connectivity, data collection, and machine learning, we are moving towards a world where the abstraction of reality we used to see in a map can finally be juxtaposed into the real world by the lenses of our gadgets. And, with that, comes the possibility of  immersing the user in the hidden narratives about those locations. \r\n<br><br>\r\nBy blending the virtual and physical worlds and giving the user control of the point of view, new opportunities of narrative interaction emerge. Simultaneously, new challenges related to technical performance and user experience are presented to us. Through the perspective of AR development, UX design and extensive User Testing, the goal of this Thesis is to analyze the process of developing Augmented Reality applications in order to suggest frameworks and best practices for creating storytelling experiences in space.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis research is a result of my contribution and development of the apps  '1968 Washington Square Park' and 'Al Mahjar: the story of the Poets of Little Syria'. Even though the projects differ in content and location, both use AR to play with the relations between time and space: visitors are immersed in the same spot they are physically standing in, the way it was in the past, and are invited to interact with the historical content around them. \r\n<br><br>\r\nRead the full research article on https://medium.com/@ilanabonder/https-medium-com-stories-through-space-3d5ec0548ebb\r\n","context_research":"1968 Washington Square Park, is a project built in collaboration with the designer and content creator Hadar Ben-Tzur in a fellowship with History Channel and NYC Media Lab. It tells the story of two young activists in the midst of the Vietnam War, Civil Rights Movement and Women's Liberation protests. The app can be experienced in Washington Square Park, Manhattan, NY. \r\nDownload the app at https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1968WSQP/id1461671466\r\n<br><br>\r\nAl Mahjar: the story of the Poets of Little Syria, is a partnership with Pioneer Works, Edge of Arabia and the Washington Street Historical Society. The project's goal is to turn an existing walking tour into a mobile app, making the story of the first Arab immigrants in New York City more accessible and interactive. The experience is located in the Financial District area, also in Manhattan, NY, region that about a century ago was known as Little Syria.\r\n\r\n","technical_details":"This AR mobile Apps were developed using Unity, ArKit, ArCore and the Mapbox SDK.","further_reading":"","tags":[{"name":"History","slug":"history"},{"name":"Mobile","slug":"mobile"},{"name":"Narrative/Storytelling","slug":"narrative-storytelling"},{"name":"UX","slug":"ux"},{"name":"VR/AR/Immersive","slug":"vr-ar-immersive"}],"video_presentation_url":"https://vimeo.com/337308962","video_documentation_url":"https://vimeo.com/manage/269872207/general","project_url":"https://medium.com/@ilanabonder/https-medium-com-stories-through-space-3d5ec0548ebb","headshot":{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/my_photo.png","title":"my_photo","alt":"photo of Ilana Bonder","caption":""},"thumbnail_image":{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/THUMB_4-1024x576.jpg","title":"THUMB_4","alt":"stories through space thumb","caption":"stories through space thumb"},"slide_show":[{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/THESIS_WEB1-1024x576.png","title":"stories_through_space","alt":"Stories Through Space: an exploration of augmented reality and geolocation as a tool for historical, interactive digital storytelling.","caption":"Stories Through Space: an exploration of augmented reality and geolocation as a tool for historical, interactive digital storytelling."},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/THESIS_WEB2-1024x576.png","title":"washington_sq_park","alt":"This research is a result of my contribution and development of the apps '1968 Washington Square Park' and 'Al Mahjar: the story of the Poets of Little Syria'.","caption":"This research is a result of my contribution and development of the apps  '1968 Washington Square Park' and 'Al Mahjar: the story of the Poets of Little Syria'."},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/THESIS_WEB3-1024x576.png","title":"little_syria","alt":"This research is a result of my contribution and development of the apps '1968 Washington Square Park' and 'Al Mahjar: the story of the Poets of Little Syria'.","caption":"This research is a result of my contribution and development of the apps  '1968 Washington Square Park' and 'Al Mahjar: the story of the Poets of Little Syria'."},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/THESIS_WEB5-1024x576.png","title":"user testing","alt":"By using AR and Geolocation to bind space and time, visitors can now experience the same spot they are physically standing in, the way it was in the past.","caption":"By using AR and Geolocation to bind space and time, visitors can now experience the same spot they are physically standing in, the way it was in the past."},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/THESIS_WEB_4-1024x576.png","title":"development template","alt":"Development template created to be used as a base for projects with AR+geolocation.","caption":"Development template created to be used as a base for projects with AR+geolocation."}]}
