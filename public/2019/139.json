More specifically, this project explored and compared different possible way to integrate AR with smart toys from the very beginning - tracking. The whole process would be Detection, Augmentation, Tracking, and Interaction. Detection and Tracking, are the most two essential parts. The possible solutions for tracking smart toys/objects in AR are Image Target, 3D Object Detection and Tracking, Direct location information sent by smart toys and Machine Learning. This project compared and experimented those possible ways of detection and tracking, and finally decided to go with Machine Learning.  The project also experimented and investigated different approach towards better interactions in AR.
