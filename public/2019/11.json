The application also educates the user about climate change. ","abstract":"Rokas is a 3D application that allows users to explore how an African city, in this case Kampala, can build buildings that contribute the least possible amount of greenhouse gas emissions. It also allows users to establish how the city can create carbon sinks (forests, wetlands, grasslands) for those greenhouse gas emissions cannot be avoided. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAfrica covers a surface area that can contain the United States, China and India- the top three greenhouse gas emitters in the world today. Africa’s population growth is currently the highest in the world at 2.5 percent with 1.3 billion additional Africans expected by 2050. It also has the fastest urbanization rate of 3.5 percent per year with half of Africa’s 2.5 billion people expected to be living in urban cities in 2050. This predicts Africa having a big part to play in climate change in the near future.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMy target audience are students and my proposal is shaping the future of Africa through education. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is because 60 percent of the African population are below the age of 25 years. Uganda has the second youngest population in the world with 78 percent below 30 years of age. Therefore, the type of Climate Change Education that the youth in an African country such as Uganda receive will determine where the continent is positioned regarding its positive or negative contribution towards climate change in the coming years.\r\n","context_research":"An important part of my research was regarding the extent to which cities in Africa in this case, Kampala were emulating the modern city design of developed countries like the United States during building construction. I traveled to Kampala during my spring break in March 2019 and the simulations of glass box architecture were very much apparent. I contacted various individuals including a senior architect in Kampala, Architect Kabuye Emmanuel, who has been in the building sector in Uganda for over 30 years. <br><br>\r\nHe indicated that due to pressure from clients who insisted on having the ‘modern buildings’ that they had seen in cities in developed countries, many Architects were designing glass buildings that create a greenhouse effect and needed artificial cooling hence requiring a lot of energy. This meant that more fossil fuels would be needed to be burnt in the future to meet the energy needs that come along with this new trend. <br><br>\r\nIt also became clear that while there is a Government body mandated to protect the environment and protect carbon sinks such as wetlands (National Environmental Management Authority- Uganda), there is no visible evidence of that mandate being carried out. Therefore the rising greenhouse gas emissions from future construction projects which should be absorbed by the carbon sinks such as forests or wetlands, would then be sent to the atmosphere hence contributing to global warming.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nI further spoke to individuals in the education field who supported the creation and use of an interactive application from which students would learn how to make sustainable choices. \r\nI was pleased to discover through talking to one of the worker's of Uganda's biggest telecomm company and Internet service providers, that the company offers discounted internet plans to schools and businesses. This would support the running of the application since the it would require reliable internet access to function efficiently. \r\n","technical_details":"Rokas is a 3D desktop application with the desktop being the platform of choice so as to make it accessible to both schools with internet access and those with limited internet access while providing enough computer processing power to run the application’s 3D environment seamlessly.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI'm using Unity with C# since the application will require 3D models to be imported or used from the library as well as materials selection and general building design. \r\n","further_reading":"<p>For the user experience;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The user would access the application on a desktop computer.</li>\n<li>Since my current focus is Kampala city, the user would select a region from a list of different regions in Kampala.</li>\n<li>A real 3D map of the landscape and accurate location would be loaded. The user would be able to rotate the map, zoom in and out and load objects onto it.</li>\n<li>To begin working on a building project, they would select a building model from existing building templates, upload their own or build one.</li>\n<li>They would then choose from a selection of building materials. The material section would list different types of materials, their local names and how to obtain them.</li>\n<li>There would also be an option for energy sources. Here the user would learn about for example solar energy and how to use it, how to generate wind energy or geothermal, in order to power their homes or projects.</li>\n<li>There would be links for further learning about materials or energy sources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For sufficient support, I consulted individuals in Uganda in particular fields related to my project.</p>\n<p>Education, building and architecture, internet service provers, agriculture and youth development.</p>\n<p>Some of my inspirations include;<br />\n<a href=\"https://architecture2030.org/design_and_planning/\">Architecture 2030 </a>a nonprofit committed to transforming the building sector from the major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions to being apart of the solution in the climate change and energy crisis.<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI\">Ecologist Allan Savory</a> inspired my process when determining how the Rokas application should approach creation of carbon sinks.<br />\n<a href=\"https://world-draw.appspot.com/explore\">World-draw</a></p>\n","tags":[{"name":"3D","slug":"3d"},{"name":"Culture","slug":"culture"},{"name":"Data","slug":"data"},{"name":"Design","slug":"design"},{"name":"Education","slug":"education"},{"name":"Social Good/Activism","slug":"social-good-activism"}],"video_presentation_url":"https://vimeo.com/336814404","video_documentation_url":"https://www.anitambabazi.com/rokas/videos","project_url":"https://www.anitambabazi.com/rokas","headshot":{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_9310-929x1024.jpg","title":"IMG_9310","alt":"Anita","caption":""},"thumbnail_image":{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/k2-1024x585.jpg","title":"Kawuku village","alt":"kawuku village in Kampala","caption":""},"slide_show":[{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-05-10-at-6.52.41-PM-1024x500.png","title":"Screen Shot 2019-05-10 at 6.52.41 PM","alt":"wireframe","caption":""},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-05-10-at-7.03.52-PM-1024x515.png","title":"Screen Shot 2019-05-10 at 7.03.52 PM","alt":"wireframe","caption":""},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kawukuvillage3-1024x319.jpg","title":"kawukuvillage3","alt":"rokas","caption":""},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/11.jpg","title":"11","alt":"rokas","caption":""}]}
