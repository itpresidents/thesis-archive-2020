What's the line between productivity software and malware? How can user interfaces express humor?","abstract":"\"Unexpected behavior of common Windows makes you meditate about techno-determinism. We call it misuse of technology; we do it consciously; we create the new beauty.\" - Alexei Shulgin\r\n<br><br>\r\nViral Media is a series of experiments in writing malware as a creative practice. These programs use hacks and exploits to elicit unexpected behavior from familiar user interfaces, taking the computer desktop as a site for playful intervention. The final output of this project is a set of three pieces of malware masquerading as productivity software produced by f(utility) labs, a research division of a fictional company called the Functional Utilities Corporation.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe first of these productivity tools / viruses is a \"document optimizer\" that hijacks the copy/paste clipboard to insert generic business stock photos into any open text editor. The second is a \"break timer\" that periodically reminds you to take a break from your work by showing you an unhideable popup alert that actively moves away from your mouse when you try to close it. The third is a \"distraction manager\" that minimizes any open windows by taking control of the mouse and automatically clicking on the minimize button for each window.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhy was I interested in the desktop? The computer desktop is an everyday visual environment that mediates our digital interactions, an interface so ubiquitous as to be almost invisible. The desktop is a private space, a virtual extension of our mental landscape that we rarely allow others to access. The desktop is sterile, functional, and full of corporate branding. All of these qualities combined make the desktop an interesting target for intervention.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMy research for this project touches on several conceptual threads: the voyeuristic tension that occurs when the desktop is made public in a performance context, a feeling of estrangement or defamiliarization that is evoked by misbehaving interfaces, and questions of control and trust that arise when someone is asked to run a “virus”-like program on their own computer.","context_research":"I first became interested in the idea of \"art malware\" after seeing two different projects in person several years ago. The first was Descent.exe, a video virus by Peter Burr and Mark Fingerhut that depicts scenes loosely inspired by Bruegel the Elder's painting The Triumphs of Death while filling your desktop with a plague of rat files. The other was DesktopBAM, a performance piece by the Japanese media art duo Exonemo in which a computer mouse plays beats by triggering sound and video with inhuman speed and accuracy. These two projects showed me that it was possible to take user interface elements as raw materials for an art work.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnother reference for this project was the user interface games of Pippin Barr, particularly Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: UI Edition, in which the user acts out well-known myths through Windows 95-esque UI interactions. Barr's conceptual framing of interfaces as expressions or performances of emotion was very influential on my thought process.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNathalie Lawhead’s game A_DESKTOP_LOVE_STORY is probably the best example that I found of an interactive narrative that plays out on the computer desktop and reacts to the location of files and folders within the filesystem.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLastly, net artist Alexei Shulgin’s curatorial project Desktop IS was a useful visual reference for prepared desktops, and was helpful for figuring out how to talk about the desktop as a space in my writing.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor a full bibliography, see the “Further Reading” section.","technical_details":"I wrote most of my malware in C++ using the creative coding library openFrameworks. I chose C++ because it’s the only programming language that allows you to directly manipulate low level operating system behaviors on both Windows and MacOS.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI explored a variety of malware-esque techniques, including: transparent windows, mouse and keyboard automation, window movement and resizing, file icon movement, creating and deleting files, opening many instances of an application, interprocess communication using OSC broadcasts, and displaying real time content as a desktop background.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor some experiments, I also used Unity in conjunction with Syphon/Spout to send real time 3D scenes to openFrameworks windows.","further_reading":"<p>Bibliography</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Video\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/195036249\"><i>DESCENT.exe</i></a>, Peter Burr, Mark Fingerhut, and Forma</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/326204191/1ba56aaea2\"><i>DROP CITY</i></a>, Peter Burr, Mark Fingerhut, Oren Shoham, and John Also Bennett</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://exonemo.com/works/desktopbam/\"><i>DesktopBAM</i></a>, Exonemo</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/177929893\"><i>Desktop Deltawave</i></a>, Mark Fingerhut</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/20967400\"><i>QTzrk_loop</i></a>, Jon Satrom</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Games\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-ui-edition/\"><i>Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: UI Edition</i></a>, Pippin Barr (<a href=\"https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-ui-edition\">github</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pippinbarr.github.io/itisasifyouweremakinglove/\"><i>It is as if you were making love</i></a>, Pippin Barr (<a href=\"https://github.com/pippinbarr/itisasifyouweremakinglove\">github</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pippinbarr.github.io/itisasifyouweredoingwork/\"><i>It is as if you were doing work</i></a>, Pippin Barr (<a href=\"https://github.com/pippinbarr/itisasifyouweredoingwork\">github</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gentle-virus.itch.io/caliban-filesystem-survival\"><i>Caliban</i></a>, Mark Fingerhut</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://alienmelon.itch.io/lovestory\"><i>A_DESKTOP_LOVE_STORY</i></a>, Nathalie Lawhead</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://unicornycopia.com/graveyard/cyberpet.html\"><i>Cyberpet Graveyard</i></a>, Nathalie Lawhead</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://alienmelon.itch.io/electric-file-monitor\"><i>Electric File Monitor</i></a>, Nathalie Lawhead</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://porpentine.itch.io/foldscape\"><i>Foldscape</i></a>, Porpentine Charity Heartscape</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/429720/IMSCARED/\"><i>IMSCARED</i></a>, Ivan Zanotti</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ddlc.moe/\"><i>Doki Doki Literature Club!</i></a>, Dan Salvato, Satchely, and Velinquent</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Net Art\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.easylife.org/desktop/\"><i>Desktop Is</i></a>, Alexei Shulgin</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/16355410\"><i>MY%Desktop\\2002</i></a>, JODI</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Books\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://art.yale.edu/file_columns/0000/1404/galloway_alexander_r_-_the_interface_effect.pdf\"><i>The Interface Effect</i></a>, Alexander Galloway</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://the-eye.eu/public/Books/IT%20Various/ADDISON.WESLEY.COMPUTER.AS.THEATRE.2ND.EDITION.2014.pdf\"><i>Computers as Theatre</i></a>, Brenda Laurel</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Articles/Blog Posts\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arena-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/3101391/431f48e3a6a088b5c6d91468a7faf501.pdf?1543260491\"><i>(*screenshots)</i></a>, Rosa Menkman</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nickbriz.com/thoughtsonglitchart/\"><i>Thoughts on Glitch Art</i></a>, Nick Briz</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://alienmelon.itch.io/lovestory/devlog/60795/a-desktop-love-story-design-technical-notes\"><i>A_DESKTOP_LOVE_STORY Design and Technical Notes</i></a>, Nathalie Lawhead</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nathalielawhead.com/candybox/virtual-pets-and-digital-toys\"><i>Virtual Pets and Digital Toys</i></a>, Nathalie Lawhead</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pippinbarr.com/words/2017/06/14/narrative-framing-in-it-is-as-if-you-were-doing-work.html\"><i>Narrative framing in It is as if you were doing work</i></a>, Pippin Barr</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://calibanfilesystem.tumblr.com/\"><i>Caliban Dev Log</i></a>, Mark Fingerhut</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ravenkwok.tumblr.com/post/161396369370/windows-mitosis\"><i>Windows Mitosis</i></a>, Raven Kwok</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://filmstudiesforfree.blogspot.com/2015/04/on-desktop-documentary-or-kevin-b-lee.html\"><i>On Desktop Documentary</i></a>, Kevin B.
