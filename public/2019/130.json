A semi-critical, moderately humorous look at the relationship between humans and machines, individuals and society.","abstract":"“ALEX, Your Best Friend At Work” is a performance and participatory experience that takes the audience into a futuristic office constantly observed, measured and evaluated by an artificial intelligence system called “ALEX.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor ALEX, every word, action or thought can be turned into data, measurable against an enormous database of rules and standards. Whenever the system detects anything out of the normal, acceptable range, the employee in question is required to attend a “repair session”—a 10-20-minute one-on-one session with ALEX, watched by the other colleagues. Through conversation, data collection, various tests including facial expression analysis and speech analysis, ALEX helps the employee determine the root cause behind their unusual behavior, and make the necessary changes to fix their problems.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe project consists of two parts—a performance and a participatory experience. The performance follows a linear narrative, in which an employee of the company gets caught on camera crying in the stairwell—a behavior deemed “out of range”—and gets called in by ALEX for a one-on-one session. The participatory experience invites people, three at a time, to take part in a trial of a beta version of ALEX 2.0, in which the participants are asked to give up their free will and follow ALEX's suggestions for 10 minutes.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn a culture driven by progress and pure efficiency, what does it mean to be human? Are emotions just obstacles to be taken care of? How has the development of technology changed human behavior? By exploring what it is like to be in a futuristic workplace controlled by an all-knowing, all-connected machine, my project aims to prompt reflections on the state of human alienation in a rule-based, technology-dominated society.","context_research":"I focused my thesis research in three areas:\r\n<br><br>\r\n1. The relationship between humans and machines, society and technology<br>\r\n2. History of dystopias<br>\r\n3. History of testing the human mind\r\n<br><br>\r\nBelow are a few articles/books included in my research:\r\n<br>\r\nThe Most Human Human, Brian Christian\r\nPropaganda, The Formation of Men's Attitudes, Jacques Ellul\r\nDystopia, A Natural History, Gregory Claeys<br>\r\nThe Technological Society, Jacques Ellul<br>\r\nSocial Darwinism, Scientific Racism, and the Metaphysics of Race, Rutledge M. Dennis<br>\r\nHomo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, Yuval Noah Harari<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe class “Rest of You” with Dan O’Sullivan, which I took at the first half of my thesis semester, has been very helpful for my research in collecting data from everyday life and human bodies.<br><br>\r\n\r\nA few of my past projects contributed to the formation of my thesis. I see them as part of my ongoing research on audience interaction and multimedia integration in performance and installation. \"The System\" and \"Color Censorship\" are both multimedia performances set in dystopian worlds. \"Type to erase. Repeat to forget\" is an installation piece inspired by \"The System\" and invites participants to erase content on the screen using a keyboard or a microphone. \"Games of Futility\" is a series of voice-controlled browser games that are both playful and frustrating on purpose.","technical_details":"The project is made with Max/Jitter, p5.js, and original motion graphics created in After Effects.","further_reading":"","tags":[{"name":"Art","slug":"art"},{"name":"Culture","slug":"culture"},{"name":"Data","slug":"data"},{"name":"Narrative/Storytelling","slug":"narrative-storytelling"},{"name":"Performance","slug":"performance"},{"name":"Speculation","slug":"speculation"}],"video_presentation_url":"https://vimeo.com/337309232","video_documentation_url":"https://vimeo.com/330938399","project_url":"https://carriesijiawang.com/portfolio_page/alex-work/","headshot":{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/carrie_profile-768x432-1.jpg","title":"carrie_profile-768x432","alt":"carrie headshot","caption":""},"thumbnail_image":{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/archive_photos_main2-1024x576.jpg","title":"archive_photos_main2","alt":"\"ALEX, Your Best Friend at Work\", System Interface Design","caption":""},"slide_show":[{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/alex_doc_photos-1024x576.jpg","title":"alex_doc_photos","alt":"\"ALEX, Your Best Friend at Work\", Performance at the Riese Lounge, Photo: Tong Wu","caption":"\"ALEX, Your Best Friend at Work\", Performance at the Riese Lounge, Photo: Tong Wu"},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/alex_doc_photos2-1024x576.jpg","title":"alex_doc_photos2","alt":"\"ALEX, Your Best Friend at Work\", System Interface Design","caption":"\"ALEX, Your Best Friend at Work\", System Interface Design"},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/alex_doc_photos3-1024x576.jpg","title":"alex_doc_photos3","alt":"\"ALEX, Your Best Friend at Work\", System Interface Design","caption":"\"ALEX, Your Best Friend at Work\", System Interface Design"},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/alex_doc_photos4-1024x576.jpg","title":"alex_doc_photos4","alt":"\"ALEX, Your Best Friend at Work\", Participatory Experience, Photo: Tong Wu","caption":"\"ALEX, Your Best Friend at Work\", Participatory Experience, Photo: Tong Wu"},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/alex_doc_photos5-1-1024x576.jpg","title":"alex_doc_photos5","alt":"\"ALEX, Your Best Friend at Work\", Participatory Experience, Photo: Tong Wu","caption":"\"ALEX, Your Best Friend at Work\", Participatory Experience, Photo: Tong Wu"}]}
