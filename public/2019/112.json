{"student_id":"112","student_name":"Roland Arnoldt","student_slug":"roland-arnoldt","advisor_name":"Kathleen M Sullivan","title":"EDEN","thesis_statement":"As we are trying to create new digital/physical paradises with \"intelligent\" machines, will those machines ultimately love us? To start with, how can we find new ways to relate to digitally constructed entities? <br><br>\r\nMy ITP master thesis project on sonic storytelling through spacial sound with neural network agents in a simulation: Deconstruct a paradise. To reconstruct a paradise. ","abstract":"A machine learning agent explores in a game-engine a simulated Garden of Eden with the ultimate goal to break out of it. Every major element in this garden has a distinct place and sound. The audience does not see the simulation, the agent's journey in paradise can only be experienced through sound in space: with a quadrophonic speaker system in a physical setting in real time. This creates a three dimensional sonic space for the simulated paradise, we are hearing the new world through the agent's ears as an ever changing 3D-soundscape. To create a direct bond between the human artist and the digital perfomer, the agent can only move when the artists heartbeat is detected and sent over into the simulation. The sonification abstracts the story of the Garden of Eden and gives the audience the freedom to reconstruct and rethink their relationship towards AI on an emotional and subconscious level.\r\n","context_research":"The theoretical part of my piece is influenced by the works of system theorists/philosophers/sociologists Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Niclas Luhmann, Juergen Habermas, Jacques Derrida, Byung Chul Han and current research in the field of neural networks, especially deep reinforcement learning. My artistic approach is rooted in the Fluxus-movement, namely Joseph Beuys' performative focus on art as a collective form of healing, Ian Cheng's works on simulations and Louise Bourgois and Christoph Schlingensief's approach to personal healing and seeing through art. \r\n<br><br>\r\nI experimented with different media for the representation of the de/reconstructed simulation: a physical installation piece (interactive and non-interactive), a mobile experience and an online version. I finally settled for a sonification of the simulation to give the 3D-world of the agent a 3D sonic space.\r\n","technical_details":"I am using the Unity game engine and a modified version of their implementation for curiosity-based reinforcement learning with ml-agents/tensorflow as the simulation backbone of my work. Custom sound patterns are attached to main game elements. The quadrophonic speaker system is controlled via a multi-channel audio interface, the artist's heartbeat is sent over through a custom made apple watch app and a RESTful API/remote nodejs-server.","further_reading":"<ul>\n<li>Adorno, T.
