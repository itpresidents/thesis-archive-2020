It is intended to provide a way to reconstruct archival, historical and pre-existing images and video in 3D space. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy providing an interface to bridge between machine learning and storytelling practices, Volume enables content creators to easily prototype 3D assets from 2D images and video in Augmented, Virtual and Mixed reality environments. Volume is built as a cloud service, which abstracts all the machine learning processing and provides a simple interface to reconstruct and view your assets. Upon reconstruction, you are able to download and use these assets in popular game engines such as Unity, Unreal or Three.js using the Volume plugin. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVolume's main audience are content creators. By allowing anyone, with no previous coding background, to easily prototype 3D Volume encourages inclusion in the content creation process.","short_description":"3D photography and immersive mediums have been booming over the past years. Culturally, 2D images have been an integral part of how we develop an identity. Given the transition from 2D to 3D, how can we use historical, archival and pre-existing 2D images and video in the 3D era?","further_reading":"<p><b>  Tools:</b>  </p>\n<p><i>  Make - WebGL</i>  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juniorxsound/thesis-assets/master/make.png\" /><br />\nMake Volume, is the online interface for content creators allowing to easily upload, save and export Volume assets from your personal account.</p>\n<p><i>  Volume Unity Plugin</i>  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Volume-GL/Volume-Unity-Plugin/master/Docs/scene.gif\" /></p>\n<p>Volume Unity Plugin allows you to easily render Volume exported assets.
