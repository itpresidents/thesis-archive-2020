Fairy tales are stories that were told to children as a way to teach in indirect, fanciful and metaphorical ways how to grow up in their culture. But in the 21st century, mass media entertainment has become the primary source for children\u2019s development and how they perceive the world. \r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nUnfortunately, there has been a significant lack of representation of marginalized communities in the mainstream media for decades. Increasingly people are speaking out about not seeing a representation of themselves on television or in movies when growing up. As a Turkmen filmmaker and a new media artist, this issue was undoubtedly part of my own childhood. I found it troubling to see that the problems are presently stressed via conversation, but not much is done to solve them. For my thesis, I had to ask myself: is it possible to create a narrative experience that tells a unique and meaningful story to every individual user, tailored to their culture?  \r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI decided to start with a culture I know best, my own. I reached out to the small Turkmen community in NYC and found many Turkmen-American children, who are in the midst of developing their identity. After my research with children, I realized that I had to put media in children\u2019s hands, and give them a voice to represent their own stories and experiences. I developed an immersive installation <i>Erteki<\/i>, which listens to children\u2019s stories and illustrates them live, using speech recognition, machine learning and projection. <i>Erteki<\/i>, or fairy tale, is designed to make stories and characters come to life in a magical experience. By providing a platform that empowers children with authorship over their own narratives, I hope that they grow up feeling included and visible.

Most of the information about their artwork and projects lives within a few concentrated online publishing platforms and social networks, and these companies typically control access to the information and how it is presented. For artists of all kinds, this turns out to be a huge threat; not only in terms of the openness of the web and the artist\u2019s ability to maintain control over their intellectual property but also as an impediment to creative expression and sustainable ways to archive and distribute artwork digitally. \r\n\r\nArchetype aims to address the centralization and standardization of creative expression of how works of arts often inhabit the web. An alternative, independent and experimental set of desktop publishing tools that enable artists to share their artwork online without having to depend on centralized publishing platforms or cloud computing services. \r\n\r\nThe project runs on a distributed peer-to-peer network using the DAT Protocol (https:\/\/datproject.org), which adds important characteristics to the publishing practice. It enables the publishing of content from any device connected to the network, including an artist\u2019s individual personal computer. \r\n\r\nUnlike centralized models, where company-owned servers assume the right of publishing, a peer-to-peer protocol enables any computer, even an artist\u2019s personal computer, the right to serve content,  allowing affordable and accessible alternatives to the display of information online. In addition, DAT, allows users to distribute data through an archive system, enabling features like going back and revert previous versions. Distributed archive systems follow a bottom-up model which makes interconnected data solutions possible. Artists\u2019 collections of work can be integrated together allowing anyone interested to contribute and participate.","short_description":"<i>Archetype.cc<\/i> is a response to my thesis question: How can a peer-to-peer network offer new and beneficial ways for artists to display and share their work on the web? \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to design and prototype accessible, open source tools focused on the publishing of artistic material in a p2p network.","portfolio_icon":{"src":"https:\/\/itp.nyu.edu\/thesis2018\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/arche.jpg","title":"archetype","alt":"archetype","caption":""},"topics":[{"name":"Culture","slug":"culture"},{"name":"Tool\\Service","slug":"toolservice"}]},{"student_id":"2","student_name":"Alex Fast","student_slug":"alex-fast","advisor_id":"114","project_title":"See the Ball","project_question":"What makes a baseball player good?

Unfortunately, the traits of domestic abuse are so counter-intuitive that attempts to look at it through the lens of common sense can actually drive you further away from the truth.\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nResearch has found that a lot of people still believe that domestic violence happens elsewhere.

My objective of this project is to mediate augmentation and reality by diminishing the barrier between the virtual and physical world.\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI build a set of prototyping interfaces where augmentation takes an essential role as the controller. It \"a visual controller\" works; when a droplet is given to start in a virtual space, the physical object built with neo pixels will be operated by a user's dropping motion. It is the interactable element is calling assigned states to change the physical object so that it looks gradually soaking from the virtual waterdrop. Since the idea of getting users to control intuitively is my goal, user experiences I want to create though augmentation is prominent. Next, thunder has interaction with the physical object as well. In particular, thunder is created in a virtual space shown on your device. Once a user hits it the physical object will be x-rayed to reflect the thunders at a certain level. Lastly, a pinwheel is rotating at different speed consoled by users' interactivity, it will create augmentation of flying particles.\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt overlays augmented environment with a physical environment to interact while using this app. It enables virtual objects to be controlled at precise positions and depths. As a virtual object composed of GUI appears in mid-air shown on their mobile screen, the user can change the physical object. Users thereby enjoy the interaction with the physical environment using a virtual object.","short_description":"<i>Droplet<\/i> is an experimental system for designing intuitive, natural interfaces for AR applications.

For my thesis, I wanted to make a game that creates a safe space for people to discuss politics. \r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn Awkward Thanksgiving, players begin by adopting an ideology: libertarian, progressive, socialist, etc. This is the ideology that they must represent throughout the game.

The combination of fear and physiological symptoms continues to heighten one another, escalating the panic attack. Paralyzed with fear, one\u2019s breathing becomes short and shallow.

How is expectation for performance established and understood in a context?\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFrom the earliest artworks to the printed book to streaming video, technology has extended one\u2019s capacity to represent oneself. But technology also extends one\u2019s capacity to identify ourselves and others. Through computer vision and machine learning, this capacity to identify is extended to technology\u2014independently of a contingent and changing psyche, or as an extension of the psyche who made it.\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nContext as the situation of and relationships between, technology and bodies in space. Context establishes an expectation for performance, from which bodies are identified. A public restroom, a library, and a sports field are all examples of where a combination of signs, objects, uniforms, and spatial arrangements, are used to identify and enforce an expectation of a particular performance.\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nContingency of the body-psyche can mean choosing to participate, where an example might be rejecting a gendered discourse through drag as discussed by Judith Butler. But there\u2019s also contingency in the material condition of the body. Bodies come in all shapes, sizes, and capacities. Because of this contingency, our bodies may or may not be identified by the expected standards of a technology.

While we naturally think of light as something which illuminates the space around us, fire occupied a pivotal role in the religious beliefs of in ancient days and now candlelight is still widely used from meditation to social movements like tribute ceremonies or protests.\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo I started to imagine\u2014what if the most recent lighting technologies can mimic the restorative properties of ancient light?
