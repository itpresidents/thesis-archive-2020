And so The Plaza Project poses questions to and attempts to convey the opinions, attitudes, and values of the public.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe project hosts a growing database of active polls.  The questions on which the polls are based are taken from the news, political surveys, local ballots, personality quizzes, dating websites, psychology tests, morality tests, and canonical philosophy.  Questions also come directly from users.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nResponses are visualized across time, geography, and population segments so that the public may see how opinions change from one year to another, across the countryâ€™s fifty states, and between American identities, age groups, and political affiliations.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe open network democratizes public opinion polling, which until now has been conducted by small yet influential organizations like the Pew Research Center, Gallup, and national news organizations, and gives everyday people a forum to ask and be asked important questions.","short_description":"<i>Plaza</i> is an open-sourced platform for measuring and visualizing public opinion over space, time, and population segments on political, moral, and philosophical questions.","further_reading":"","portfolio_icon":{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PlazaThumbnail.png","title":"PlazaThumbnail","alt":"Plaza logo","caption":""},"topics":[{"name":"Data","slug":"data"},{"name":"Society","slug":"society"}],"video_presentation_url":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/269233211","video_documentation_url":"","project_url":"https://plazaproject.cc","description":"","featured_image":[{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PlazaThumbnail.png","title":"PlazaThumbnail","alt":"Plaza logo","caption":""}],"slide_show":[{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1-8-1024x774.png","title":"1","alt":"Polls","caption":""},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2-5-1024x665.png","title":"2","alt":"Ask a question","caption":""},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-5-1024x631.png","title":"3","alt":"Question","caption":""},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/4-4-1024x731.png","title":"4","alt":"Data viz","caption":""}]}
