However, it is still quite easy for us to get lost inside large, indoor venues. To fill the gap, I created an app prototype with customized 3D venue models and inside structures based on Grand Central Station in New York City, which people can use to navigate around and search for their destination. Augmented routes are shown on screen with real-time distance information giving the most intuitive guidance to people.","short_description":"<i>PathIndoor</i> is an augmented reality wayfinding app that helps people navigate inside large venues with interactive 3D maps and realtime route information.","further_reading":"","portfolio_icon":{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/thumbnail-2.png","title":"thumbnail","alt":"thumbnail","caption":""},"topics":[{"name":"UX\\UI","slug":"uxui"},{"name":"VR\\AR","slug":"vr-ar"}],"video_presentation_url":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/269233136","video_documentation_url":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/265858288","project_url":"https://www.linyang.work/pathindoor","description":"","featured_image":[{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/thumbnail-2.png","title":"thumbnail","alt":"thumbnail","caption":""}],"slide_show":[{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image2.png","title":"image2","alt":"logo","caption":"logo"},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image3.png","title":"image3","alt":"interface","caption":"interface"},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image1.png","title":"image1","alt":"idea","caption":"Idea"},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image4.png","title":"image4","alt":"scenario","caption":"scenario"}]}
