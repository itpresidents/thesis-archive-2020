Indeed, theaters will lose their audience to other multimedia entertainments if they don’t effectively embrace and leverage the power of digital technology.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeginning in the early 1990s, videos have been used in theater performances - but not very often. Through my research and interview with theater designer, I found that there are two main difficulties when adding video projection in theater design: the high financial cost of equipments and technical support to professionally implement projection, the difficulty of timing the video content to ensure that they are injected at the 'right moment' (often by using human labor), and corresponding to the plot and actors’ expressions.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy building on top of Natural Language Processing technology, <i>Speakspeare</i> aims to solve the second problem by synchronizing live speech with digital media output, and hopefully by automating scenic control and reducing human labor, lower the cost of projection design.","short_description":"<i>Speakspeare</i> is an interface that allows stage projection mapping to change according to live speech—on stage, in real time. It connects stage design with live speech, and thus gives new creative options to projection designers, and empowers performers to act more freely on stage.","further_reading":"","portfolio_icon":{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/thumbnail-5.jpg","title":"thumbnail","alt":".","caption":""},"topics":[{"name":"Performance","slug":"performance"},{"name":"Tool\\Service","slug":"toolservice"}],"video_presentation_url":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/269196197","video_documentation_url":"","project_url":"https://www.yuepingwang.com/speech","description":"","featured_image":[{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/thumbnail-5.jpg","title":"thumbnail","alt":".","caption":""}],"slide_show":[{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pic-1.jpg","title":"pic-1","alt":".","caption":"demo-shot"},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/demo-2-1024x576.jpg","title":"pic-2","alt":".","caption":"demo-shot"},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pic-4.jpg","title":"pic-4","alt":".","caption":"interaction-diagram"},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pic-5.jpg","title":"diagram-1","alt":".","caption":"interface-flowchart"}]}
