In order to achieve the highest level of pool status a lot of practice has to come into play. And by practicing we don’t just say to hit balls and expect to get better just by doing so. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEffective practice is something that most people don’t understand when they are out there trying to shoot balls on their own and hoping to get better over the next days. There are some vital steps a player needs to follow and understand. <i>PoolBuddy</i> will help establish these steps offering an instructional training software designed for all skill levels that will help players with their practice drills and understanding of each shots and their strategy behind them. <i>PoolBuddy</i> will be projected mapped into any pool table desired and could be very easily being navigated using the App included. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeveral additional  options will be available which will include: shot replay, timer, challenges, personal records. By having drills designed or taken directly from pros all around, the level of information would be enormous and will help make players establish the proper mindset when tackling a pool table.
