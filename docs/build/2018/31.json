A custom that diligently extends into the the century old subway of the city. Subway music is unpredictable, chaotic, rebellious and these tunes reverberating underground have an ecosystem that has flourished over the years. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProtected by the First Amendment yet outlawed depending on decibel levels—whether it’s a music student rehearsing or U2 in disguise, the subways have become a unifying stage. Inspired by this ecosystem, NYC Beats was created to unravel the intricate relationships between commuters, musicians, music and locations. An interactive map of NYC made with Mapbox and Three.js, a user can navigate to find artists currently playing in the subways, a commuter can ‘spot’ musicians, and musicians can ‘geo-tag’ themselves on the map. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOfficial MTA ‘Music Under New York’ program locations are indicated on the map as hotspots. NYC Beats places the underground experience in a disparate public space, the world wide web. It breaks the fourth wall by merging the physical and the digital, bringing us together in a shared experience.
