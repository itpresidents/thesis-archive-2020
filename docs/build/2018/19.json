During the game, targets will pop up randomly in the space, the user need to hold the phone to move around discovering the target, and tapping on the screen to shoot the bullet to destroy the target. The user need to compete with their friend to shoot the targets to win more scores.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI always believe connecting people is very important for every new technical tool. So for AR, I tried to build a sharable experience through a playful way, like a multi-user game, competing with your friend in real-time.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDoing multi user AR in real time is still vary challenging. For this real-time experience to happen, the devices need to constantly do accurate and robust relocalization in order to synchronize other deviceâ€™s location and content display, which is still one of the outstanding hard problems for AR.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI used Swift, which is a native IOS programming language to develop this app. And as well as ARKit, which is a library that Apple built for doing Augmented Reality function on IOS devices.","short_description":"How can I create an AR game that involves 2-3 people of any age, that is fun, brings them joy and surprises?","further_reading":"","portfolio_icon":{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/coin@1x.jpg","title":"coin@1x","alt":"AR Thumbnail","caption":"AR Thumbnail"},"topics":[{"name":"Play","slug":"play"},{"name":"VR\\AR","slug":"vr-ar"}],"video_presentation_url":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/270207970","video_documentation_url":"","project_url":"https://github.com/yzhzyh/ThesisArchiveLink","description":"","featured_image":[{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/coin@1x.jpg","title":"coin@1x","alt":"AR Thumbnail","caption":"AR Thumbnail"}],"slide_show":[{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_5333-2-copy.png","title":"IMG_5333 2 copy","alt":"Multi-User","caption":""},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0220-2-copy.jpg","title":"IMG_0220 2 copy","alt":"Multi-User","caption":""}]}
