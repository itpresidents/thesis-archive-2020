Those blocks are strategically stacked to look solid. The back of the blocks will be lined with neo-pixels. As people approach the wall, the lights will move and light is. They will become brighter in an exponential growth - so that the light permeates the wall, and shows it to be an illusion more than anything else. \r\n\r\nTo borrow Richard Serra's words, I am showing how the viewer can become the subject of their own experience in a way that allows you to connect more readily to the world around you.","short_description":"What can a physical installation do to create better understanding between people and the walls they build around themselves?
