They were young, ambitious and came to reinvent themselves in America. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<i>Inventing America</i> is a story of a new society, a new city, being told from the point of view of a single person, an immigrant.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe project uses augmented and virtual reality technologies to explore the relations between time and space. Using their mobile devices, visitors are immersed in the same space they are physically standing in, the way it was in the past. <i>Inventing America</i> provides an opportunity to experience immigration to a new dimension, to different times, using the city of immigrants as a canvas.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI believe we are witnessing a revolution in the way we integrate digital content into our lives. Latest technologies take content beyond the screen and provide exciting new ways for us to interact with it. The novel uses of immersive media we can see today in entertainment will eventually evolve to include other aspects of our lives. <i>Inventing America</i> demonstrates the potential of using those technologies to interact with historical data, with our past, in a new vivid and engaging way.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to realize this project we developed unique solutions and tools. The process involved unique production techniques such as 3D scanning, motion, face capture, custom graphics, branching narrative mechanisms and augmented reality platforms for mapping virtual environments to physical spaces.","short_description":"An immersive journey back in time, set on Governors Island, the landing spot of the first immigrants in New York.","further_reading":"<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNrLM86iepA?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>For more information about the team behind <i>Inventing America</i>, please visit the our <a href=\"http://inventing.nyc\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>The project is supported by Havas, Verizon, the NYC media lab and is a collaboration with the Governors Island trust.</p>\n<p><b>Process</b></p>\n<p><img src=\"//www.roilev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/windmill.gif\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"//www.roilev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ARGIF_small.gif\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"//www.roilev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SceneGIF.gif\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"//www.roilev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ScanGIF.gif\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"//www.roilev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RigGIF.gif\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"//www.roilev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AnimateGIF.gif\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"//www.roilev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MoCapMe480.gif\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"//www.roilev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TamarGIF_cropped.gif\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"//www.roilev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charMoCap_320.gif\" /></p>\n","portfolio_icon":{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/thumbnail_new2.png","title":"thumbnail","alt":"","caption":"thumbnail"},"topics":[{"name":"Narrative","slug":"narrative"},{"name":"VR\\AR","slug":"vr-ar"}],"video_presentation_url":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/270206924","video_documentation_url":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/261244233","project_url":"http://inventing.nyc","description":"","featured_image":[{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/thumbnail_new2.png","title":"thumbnail","alt":"","caption":"thumbnail"}],"slide_show":[{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/landscape_thesis.png","title":"Poster","alt":"Poster","caption":"Poster"},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CompanyManThesisSize.gif","title":"ScreenShot","alt":"Screenshot","caption":""},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ipad_thesis.gif","title":"Portal","alt":"Portal","caption":"Portal"},{"src":"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/User_harry.png","title":"The experience","alt":"The experience","caption":"The experience"}]}
