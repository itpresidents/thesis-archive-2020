Then, Soundscape syncs these loops and mixes them automatically. This process could be done repeatedly to create robust sounds and interesting patterns. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery loop on Soundscape is free, open source, and available for everyone to use, mix, jam and have fun with! \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoundscape's mission is to liberate music from its common usage, such as performance art, entertainment or as a design tool. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoundscape's goal is to let those people who believe in this mission to feel connected in a way that will allow them to stay intimate with their music, but never ever alone. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusic and sound can (and should) be enjoyable as a purposeless act, or as a free jam, that is formed by the 'vibes' of the community, by the sound of the room, or by the randomness of an algorithm.","short_description":"<i>Soundscape</i> is a smart looping tool that automatically syncs your loops with music by other people around the world. It allows music lovers to experience sound and music patterns, while discovering music by other people, like yourself.
