Fairy tales are stories that were told to children as a way to teach in indirect, fanciful and metaphorical ways how to grow up in their culture. But in the 21st century, mass media entertainment has become the primary source for children’s development and how they perceive the world. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately, there has been a significant lack of representation of marginalized communities in the mainstream media for decades. Increasingly people are speaking out about not seeing a representation of themselves on television or in movies when growing up. As a Turkmen filmmaker and a new media artist, this issue was undoubtedly part of my own childhood. I found it troubling to see that the problems are presently stressed via conversation, but not much is done to solve them. For my thesis, I had to ask myself: is it possible to create a narrative experience that tells a unique and meaningful story to every individual user, tailored to their culture?  \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI decided to start with a culture I know best, my own. I reached out to the small Turkmen community in NYC and found many Turkmen-American children, who are in the midst of developing their identity. After my research with children, I realized that I had to put media in children’s hands, and give them a voice to represent their own stories and experiences. I developed an immersive installation <i>Erteki</i>, which listens to children’s stories and illustrates them live, using speech recognition, machine learning and projection. <i>Erteki</i>, or fairy tale, is designed to make stories and characters come to life in a magical experience. By providing a platform that empowers children with authorship over their own narratives, I hope that they grow up feeling included and visible.
